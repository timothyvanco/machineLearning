# Kernel Linear Regression

When dimensionality of input is $D$, one step of SGD takes $𝓞(D^3)$.

Surprisingly, we can do better under some circumstances. We start by
noting that we can write the parameters $→w$ as a linear combination
of the input features $φ(→x_i)$.

By induction, $→w = 0 = ∑_i 0 ⋅ φ(→x_i)$, and assuming $→w = ∑_i β_i ⋅ φ(→x_i)$,
after a SGD update we get
$$\begin{aligned}
→w ←& →w + α∑_i \big(t_i - →w^T φ(→x_i)\big) φ(→x_i)\\
   =& ∑_i \Big(β_i + α \big(t_i - →w^T φ(→x_i)\big)\Big) φ(→x_i).
\end{aligned}$$

A individual update is $β_i ← β_i + α\Big(t_i - →w^T φ(→x_i)\Big)$, and
substituting for $→w$ we get
$$β_i ← β_i + α\Big(t_i - ∑\nolimits_j β_j φ(→x_j)^T φ(→x_i)\Big).$$

# Kernel Linear Regression

We can formulate the alternative linear regression algorithm (it would be called
a _dual formulation_):

<div class="algorithm">

**Input**: Dataset ($⇉X = \{→x_1, →x_2, …, →x_N\} ∈ ℝ^{N×D}$, $→t ∈ ℝ^N$), learning rate $α ∈ ℝ^+$.<br>

- Set $β_i ← 0$
- Compute all values $K(→x_i, →x_j) = φ(→x_i)^T φ(→x_j)$
- Repeat
  - Update the coordinates, either according to a full gradient update:
    - $→β ← →β + α(→t-K→β)$
  - or alternatively use single-batch SGD, arriving at:
    - for $i$ in random permutation of $\{1, …, N\}$:
      - $β_i ← β_i + α\Big(t_i - ∑\nolimits_j β_j K(→x_i, →x_j)\Big)$

    In vector notation, we can write $→β ← →β + α(→t-K→β)$.
</div>

The predictions are then performed by computing $y(→x) = →w^T φ(→x) = ∑_i β_i →φ(→x_i)^T →φ(→x)$.

# Support Vector Machines

Assume we have a dataset $⇉X ∈ ℝ^{N×D}$, $→t ∈ \{-1, 1\}^N$, feature map $φ$ and model
$$y(→x) ≝ →φ(→x)^T →w + b.$$

![w=30%,f=right](../03/binary_classification.pdf)

We already know that the distance of a point $→x_i$ to the decision boundary is
$$\frac{|y(→x_i)|}{||→w||} = \frac{t_i y(→x_i)}{||→w||}.$$

We therefore want to maximize
$$\argmax_{w,b} \frac{1}{||→w||} \min_i \big[t_i (→φ(→x)^T →w + b)\big].$$

However, this problem is difficult to optimize directly.

---
# Support Vector Machines

Because the model is invariant to multiplying $→w$ and $b$ by a constant, we can
say that for the points closest to the decision boundary, it will hold that
$$t_i y(→x_i) = 1.$$

Then for all the points we will have $t_i y(→x_i) ≥ 1$ and we can simplify
$$\argmax_{w,b} \frac{1}{||→w||} \min_i \big[t_i (→φ(→x)^T →w + b)\big]$$
to
$$\argmin_{w,b} \frac{1}{2} ||→w||^2 \textrm{~given that~~}t_i y(→x_i) ≥ 1.$$

---
# Support Vector Machines

In order to solve the constrained problem of
$$\argmin_{w,b} \frac{1}{2} ||→w||^2 \textrm{~given that~~}t_i y(→x_i) ≥ 1,$$
we write the Lagrangian with multipliers $→a=(a_1, …, a_N)$ as
$$L = \frac{1}{2} ||→w||^2 - ∑_i a_i \big[t_i y(→x_i) - 1\big].$$

Setting the derivatives with respect to $→w$ and $b$ to zero, we get
$$\begin{aligned}
→w =& ∑_i a_i t_iφ(→x_i) \\
 0 =& ∑_i a_i t_i \\
\end{aligned}$$

---
# Support Vector Machines

Substituting these to the Lagrangian, we get
$$L = ∑_i a_i -  \frac{1}{2} ∑_i ∑_j a_i a_j t_i t_j K(→x_i, →x_j)$$
with respect to the constraints $∀_i: a_i ≥ 0$, $∑_i a_i t_i = 0$
and kernel $K(→x, →z) = φ(→x)^T φ(→z).$

The solution of this Lagrangian will fulfil the KKT conditions, meaning that
$$\begin{aligned}
a_i &≥ 0 \\
t_i y(→x_i) - 1 &≥ 0 \\
a_i \big(t_i y(→x_i) - 1\big) &= 0.
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, either a point is on a boundary, or $a_i=0$. Given that the
predictions for point $→x$ are given by $y(→x) = ∑ a_i t_i K(→x, →x_i) + b$,
we need to keep only the points on the boundary, the so-called **support vectors**.

# Support Vector Machines for Non-linearly Separable Data

![w=28%,f=right](svm_softmargin.pdf)

Until now, we assumed the data to be linearly separable – the  
**hard-margin SVM** variant. We now relax this condition to arrive at
**soft-margin SVM**.
The idea is to allow points to be in the margin or even on the _wrong side_ of
the decision boundary. We introduce _slack variables_ $ξ_i ≥ 0$, one for each
training instance, defined as
$$ξ_i = \begin{cases} 0 &\textrm{~for points fulfilling~}t_i y(→x_i) ≥ 1,\\
                      |t_i - y(→x_i)|&\textrm{~otherwise}.\end{cases}$$

Therefore, $ξ_i=0$ signifies a point outside of margin, $0 < ξ_i < 1$ denotes
a point inside the margin, $ξ_i=1$ is a point on the decision boundary and
$ξ_i>1$ indicates the point is on the opposite side of the separating
hyperplane.

Therefore, we want to optimize
$$\argmin_{w,b} C ∑_i ξ_i + \frac{1}{2} ||→w||^2 \textrm{~given that~~}t_i y(→x_i) ≥ 1 - ξ_i\textrm{~and~}ξ_i ≥ 0.$$

---
# Support Vector Machines for Non-linearly Separable Data

We again create a Lagrangian, this time with multipliers $→a=(a_1, …, a_N)$
and also $→μ=(μ_1, …, μ_N)$:
$$L = \frac{1}{2} ||→w||^2 + C ∑_i ξ_i - ∑_i a_i \big[t_i y(→x_i) - 1 + ξ_i\big] - ∑_i μ_i ξ_i.$$

Solving for the critical points and substituting for $→w$, $b$ and $→ξ$ (obtaining an additional
constraint $μ_i = C - a_i$ compared to the previous case), we obtain the Lagrangian in the form
$$L = ∑_i a_i -  \frac{1}{2} ∑_i ∑_j a_i a_j t_i t_j K(→x_i, →x_j),$$
which is identical to the previous case, but the constraints are a bit
different:
$$∀_i: C ≥ a_i ≥ 0\textrm{~and~}∑_i a_i t_i = 0.$$

---
# Support Vector Machines for Non-linearly Separable Data

Using KKT conditions, we can see that the support vectors (examples with
$a_i>0$) are the ones with $t_i y(→x_i) = 1 - ξ_i$.

section: SMO
# Sequential Minimal Optimization Algorithm

To solve the dual formulation of a SVM, usually Sequential Minimal Optimization
(SMO; John Platt, 1998) algorithm is used.

Before we introduce it, we start by introducing **coordinate descent**
optimization algorithm.

Consider solving unconstrained optimization problem
$$\argmin_→w L(w_1, w_2, …, w_D).$$

Instead of the usual SGD approach, we could optimize the weights one by one,
using the following algorithm

<div class="algorithm">

- loop until convergence
  - for $i$ in $\{1, 2, …, D\}$:
    - $w_i ← \argmin\nolimits_{w_i} L(w_1, w_2, …, w_D)$
</div>

# Sequential Minimal Optimization Algorithm

<div class="algorithm">

- loop until convergence
- for $i$ in $\{1, 2, …, D\}$:
  - $w_i ← \argmin\nolimits_{w_i} L(w_1, w_2, …, w_D)$
</div>

![w=42%,f=right](../06/coordinate_descent.pdf)

If the inner $\argmin$ can be performed efficiently, the coordinate descent can
be fairly efficient.

Note that we might want to choose $w_i$ in different order, for example
by trying to choose $w_i$ providing the largest decrease of $L$.

---
# Sequential Minimal Optimization Algorithm

In soft-margin SVM, we try to minimize
$$L = ∑_i a_i -  \frac{1}{2} ∑_i ∑_j a_i a_j t_i t_j K(→x_i, →x_j),$$
such that
$$∀_i: C ≥ a_i ≥ 0\textrm{~and~}∑_i a_i t_i = 0.$$

The KKT conditions for the solution are
$$\begin{aligned}
  a_i = 0 & ⇒ t_i y(→x_i) ≥ 1, \textrm{~~because in this case }μ_i = C\textrm{ and therefore }ξ_i=0 \\
  a_i = C & ⇒ t_i y(→x_i) ≤ 1, \textrm{~~because in this case }t_i y(→x_i) - 1 + ξ_i = 0\textrm{ for }ξ_i≥0 \\
  0 < a_i < C & ⇒ t_i y(→x_i) = 1, \textrm{~~because in this case both above reasonings apply}
\end{aligned}$$

---
# Sequential Minimal Optimization Algorithm

At its core, the SMO algorithm is just a coordinate descent.

It tries to find such $α_i$ fulfilling the KKT conditions – for soft-margin SVM,
KKT conditions are sufficient conditions for optimality (the loss is convex and
inequality constraints affine).

However, note that because of the $∑a_i t_i = 0$ constraint we cannot optimize
just one $a_i$, because a single $a_i$ is determined from the others.

Therefore, in each step we pick two $a_i, a_j$ coefficients and try to minimize
the loss while fulfilling the constraints.

<div class="algorithm">

- loop until convergence (until $∀ i: a_i < C ⇒ t_i y(→x_i) ≥ 1$ and $a_i > 0 ⇒  t_i y(→x_i) ≤ 1$)
  - for $i$ in $\{1, 2, …, D\}$, for $j ≠ i$ in $\{1, 2, …, D\}:
    - $a_i, a_j ← \argmin\nolimits_{a_i, a_j} L(a_1, a_2, …, a_D)$ such that $C ≥ a_i ≥ 0$, $∑_i a_i t_i = 0$
</div>

# Sequential Minimal Optimization Algorithm

The SMO is an efficient algorithm, because we can compute the update to
$a_i, a_j$ efficiently, because there exists an closed form solution.

Assume that we are updating $a_i$ and $a_j$. Then from the $∑_k a_k t_k = 0$ condition we can
write $a_i t_i = -∑_{k≠i} a_k t_k$. Given that $t_i^2 = 1$ and denoting $ζ=-∑_{k≠i, k≠j} a_k t_k$, we get
$$a_i = t_i (ζ-a_j t_j).$$

Minimizing $L(→a)$ with respect to $a_i$ and $a_j$ then amounts to minimizing
a quadratic function of $a_j$, which has an analytical solution.

Note that the real SMO algorithm has several heuristics for choosing $a_i, a_j$
such that the $L$ can be minimized the most.

section: UpdateRules
# Sequential Minimal Optimization Update Rules

We already know that $a_i = t_i (ζ-a_j t_j).$

~~~
To find $a_j$ optimizing the loss $L$, we use the formula for locating a vertex
of a parabola
$$a_j^\textrm{new} ← a_j - \frac{∂L/∂a_j}{∂^2L/∂a_j^2},$$
which is in fact one Newton-Raphson iteration step.

~~~
Denoting $E_j ≝ y(→x_j) - t_j$, we can compute the first derivative as
$$\frac{∂L}{∂a_j} = t_j (E_i - E_j)$$
and the second derivative as
$$\frac{∂^2L}{∂a_j^2} = 2K(→x_i, →x_j) - K(→x_i, →x_i) - K(→x_j, →x_j).$$

---
# Sequential Minimal Optimization Update Rules

If the second derivative is positive, we know that the vertex is really
a minimum, in which case we get

$$a_j^\textrm{new} ← a_j - t_j\frac{E_i - E_j}{2K(→x_i, →x_j) - K(→x_i, →x_i) - K(→x_j, →x_j)}.$$

~~~
We then clip $a_j$ so that $0 ≤ a_i, a_j ≤ C$, by clipping $a_j$ to range $[L, H]$ with
$$\begin{aligned}
t_i = t_j & ⇒ L = \max(0, a_i + a_j - C), H = \min(C, a_i + a_j) \\
t_i ≠ t_j & ⇒ L = \max(0, a_j - a_i), H = \min(C, C + a_j - a_i).
\end{aligned}$$

~~~
Finally we set
$$a_i^\textrm{new} ← a_i - t_i t_j\big(a_j^\textrm{new} - a_j).$$

---
# Sequential Minimal Optimization Update Rules

To arrive at the bias update, we consider the KKT condition that
for $0 < a_j^\textrm{new} < C$ it must hold that $t_j y(→x_j) = 1$. Combining it with
with $b = E_j + t_j - ∑_l a_l t_l K(→x_j, →x_l)$, we get the following
value
$$b_j = b - E_j - t_i (a_i^\textrm{new} - a_i)K(→x_i, →x_j) - t_j (a_j^\textrm{new} - a_j)K(→x_j, →x_j).$$

~~~
Analogously for $0 < a_i^\textrm{new} < C$ we get
$$b_i = b - E_i - t_i (a_i^\textrm{new} - a_i)K(→x_i, →x_i) - t_j (a_j^\textrm{new} - a_j)K(→x_j, →x_i).$$

~~~
Finally, if $a_j^\textrm{new}, a_i^\textrm{new} ∈ \{0, C\}$, we know that all values between $b_i$ and $b_j$ fulfil the KKT conditions.
We therefore arrive at the following update for bias:
$$b^\textrm{new} = \begin{cases}
  b_i & \textrm{if~~} 0 < a_i^\textrm{new} < C \\
  b_j & \textrm{if~~} 0 < a_j^\textrm{new} < C \\
  \frac{b_i + b_j}{2} & \textrm{otherwise}.
\end{cases}$$

section: MultiSVM
# Multiclass SVM

There are two general approach for building a $K$-class classifier by combining
several binary classifiers:

~~~
- **one-versus-rest** scheme: $K$ binary classifiers are constructed, the $i$-th
  separating instances of class $i$ from all others; during prediction, the
  one with highest probability is chosen

  - the binary classifiers need to return calibrated probabilities (not SVM)

~~~
- **one-versus-one** scheme: $\binom{K}{2}$ binary classifiers are constructed,
  one for each $(i, j)$ pair of class indices; during prediction, the class with
  the majority of votes wins (used by SVM)

~~~
![w=50%,f=right](ovr_ovo_failures.pdf)

However, both of the above approaches suffer from serious difficulties, because
training the binary classifiers separately creates usually several regions which
are ambiguous.
