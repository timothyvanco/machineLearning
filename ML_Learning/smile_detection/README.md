## SMILE DETECTION

I used LeNet CNN to train and then recognize, if I am smiling or not.
For training I used SMILES dataset. LeNet has 93% classification accuracy. 
Higher classification accuracy can be obtained by gathering more training data 
or applying data augmentation to existing training data.
Then I created a Python script to read frames from a webcam/video file, detect faces, 
and then apply my pre-trained network. In order to detect faces, I used OpenCVâ€™s Haar cascades. 
Once a face was detected it was extracted from the frame and then passed through LeNet to determine 
if I was smiling or not smiling.
