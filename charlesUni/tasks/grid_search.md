Starting with [grid_search.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl129/tree/master/labs/03/grid_search.py)
template, perform a hyperparameter grid search, evaluating hyperparameter performance
using a stratified k-fold crossvalidation, and finally evaluate a model
trained with best hyparparameters on all training data. The easiest way is
to utilize `sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV`.
