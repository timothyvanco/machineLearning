# NPFL129 (Machine Learning for Greenhorns) Slides

The NPFL129 (Machine Learning for Greenhorns) slides can be viewed in any modern
browser (with Chrome and Firefox tested). The slides can be printed into PDF
in Chrome and Firefox (but in Firefox you need to manually specify page size
as 297mm and 167mm).

Several key shortcuts are available:
- `h` toggles handout mode, where only complete slides are kept;
- `b` toggles background visiblity.

You can either see the slides
[on-line at ÃšFAL](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/courses/npfl129)
or locally -- but in that case you need this directory to be served by a real
web server for the AJAX requests to work. The easiest is probably to run
```
python3 -m http.server
```
and then navigating to `localhost:8000`.
